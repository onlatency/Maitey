# Venice Image Chat - Professional Media UI Redesign

## Project Vision

Transform the Venice Image Chat application into a professional tool for media creators who need to generate, classify, and manage images at scale.

## UI Redesign Plan

### 1. Left Panel - Chats & Settings

- **Chat Management**
  - Keep chats on the left side pane
  - Add checkboxes for multi-selection of chats
  - Implement different color schemes for selected/unselected chats
  - Add delete button for individual and a bulk delete button
  - Future: Add folder organization system

- **Image Settings Panel**
  - Move image settings below the chats pane
  - Keep existing settings (Model, Style, Steps, Adherence)
  - Add "Negative Prompts" text input field
  - Implement image size controls with presets:
    - Square (Default) - 1024x1024
    - Landscape (3:2) - 1264x848
    - Cinema (16:9) - 1280x720
    - Tall (9:16) - 720x1280
    - Portrait (2:3) - 848x1264
    - Instagram (4:5) - 1011x1264
    - Custom (with width/height input fields)

### 2. Main Panel - Image Gallery

- **Gallery Layout**
  - Transform main area into a responsive image gallery
  - Display all generated images in the current chat
  - Implement card-based design for each image

- **Image Cards**
  - Display generated image
  - Show prompt in scrollable 2-line text field
  - Add control buttons at the bottom:
    - Download image button
    - View full-size button (new)
    - Regenerate image button (new)
    - Copy prompt button
  - Visual indicators for generation status

### 3. Bottom Panel - Prompt Controls

- **Persistent Prompt Input**
  - Keep prompt input field at the bottom
  - Maintain editability at all times
  - Automatic height adjustment based on content

- **Control Buttons**
  - Generate button (creates new image card)
  - Lightbulb button for future "enhance prompt" feature

- **Style Quick-Select**
  - Add eight style preset buttons for quick selection
  - Visual indication of active style

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Component Structure & State Management ✅

- [x] Refactor `ChatContext.jsx` to support new data model
- [x] Create new components:
  - [x] `ChatSelector.jsx` - Enhanced chat selection component
  - [x] `ImageGallery.jsx` - Main gallery container

  - [x] `ImageSizeControl.jsx` - Size presets and custom sizing
  - [x] `StyleQuickSelect.jsx` - Style preset buttons
  - [x] `NegativePromptInput.jsx` - For negative prompts
  - [x] `PersistentPromptInput.jsx` - Enhanced prompt input

### Phase 2: Core Functionality ✅

- [x] Implement multi-selection logic for chats
- [x] Build parallel image generation capability (don't wait for previous generation)
- [x] Develop image card system with proper state management
- [x] Create negative prompt handling logic
- [x] Implement image size preset system

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features ✅

- [x] Add regeneration capability per image
- [x] Implement full-size image view
- [x] Create prompt copy functionality
- [x] Build style quick-select system
- [x] Set up infrastructure for future prompt enhancement feature

### Phase 4: UI Polish & Optimization ⏳

- [x] Design color schemes for selected/unselected states
- [x] Optimize gallery layout for different screen sizes
- [x] Add transitions and animations for smooth UX
- [x] Implement loading states and error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization for large image collections

## API Integration Updates

- [x] Extend Venice API integration for negative prompts
- [x] Add support for custom image dimensions
- [x] Implement parallel request handling
- [x] Create proper error handling for failed generations
- [x] Implement load testing for reliability under stress

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Basic chat setup with history
- [x] API integration with the Venice API
- [x] Multi-chat support
- [x] Left panel chat management
- [x] Basic settings controls
- [x] Image display and download functionality
- [x] Image style presets
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Improved error handling for reliability
  - Enhanced timeout and network error detection
  - Better user feedback for different error types
  - Streamlined error handling architecture for failed generations

## Recent Progress (May 8, 2025)

### Load Testing & Reliability Improvements

- **Load Test Results**:
  - Successfully conducted a load test with 9 concurrent image generation prompts
  - Verified that multiple images can be generated simultaneously without failures
  - Confirmed improved error handling captures and displays any issues properly
  - Tested various types of prompts to ensure consistent generation quality
  - Identified that manual prompt submission works reliably for concurrent generations

- **Error Handling Enhancements**:
  - Refactored error handling in veniceApi.js to improve clarity and reduce nesting
  - Enhanced error categorization for network issues, timeouts, and API validation
  - Improved the addNewImage function in ChatContext.jsx for clearer error reporting
  - Standardized error response format for consistent user feedback
  - Implemented proper error state persistence to prevent message disappearance
  - Added detailed logging of API requests and responses for debugging

### Previous Improvements (May 7, 2025)

- **Image Generation Fixes**:
  - Fixed issues with image generation from the prompt input
  - Repaired the regenerate button functionality on image cards
  - Ensured the settings panel correctly affects generated images
  - Fixed issue where image generation fails after deleting the last chat
  - Improved chat creation and activation process when no chats exist
  - Added support for concurrent image generation requests

- **Venice API Integration Improvements**:
  - Enhanced API request timeout handling with proper error messages
  - Added robust response validation for error conditions
  - Fixed binary image data extraction from API responses
  - Improved API key validation and error reporting
  - Extended timeout duration to accommodate longer generation times

## Known Limitations

- **Puppeteer/Chrome Test Browser Resizing Issue**: The application exhibits resizing issues specifically in Puppeteer and Chrome test automation browsers. This limitation affects the interactive resizing of sidebar panels and image size controls when using test automation frameworks. This is not expected to impact regular end-users in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browsers.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] AI prompt enhancement (lightbulb feature) - UI foundation in place
- [ ] Folder organization system for chats
- [ ] Persistent browser storage for generated images
- [ ] Batch operations on multiple images
- [ ] Export/import functionality for image collections
- [ ] Implement client-side rate limiting to prevent too many concurrent requests
- [ ] Add automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed requests
- [ ] Add API health monitoring to detect when Venice API is experiencing issues
