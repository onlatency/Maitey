# Venice Image Chat - Professional Media UI Redesign

## Project Vision

Transform the Venice Image Chat application into a professional tool for media creators who need to generate, classify, and manage images at scale.

## UI Redesign Plan

### 1. Left Panel - Chats & Settings

- **Chat Management**
  - Keep chats on the left side pane
  - Add checkboxes for multi-selection of chats
  - Implement different color schemes for selected/unselected chats
  - Add delete button for individual and a bulk delete button
  - Future: Add folder organization system

- **Image Settings Panel**
  - Move image settings below the chats pane
  - Keep existing settings (Model, Style, Steps, Adherence)
  - Add "Negative Prompts" text input field
  - Implement image size controls with presets:
    - Square (Default) - 1024x1024
    - Landscape (3:2) - 1264x848
    - Cinema (16:9) - 1280x720

    - Portrait (2:3) - 848x1264
    - Instagram (4:5) - 1011x1264
    - Custom (with width/height input fields)

### 2. Main Panel - Image Gallery

- **Gallery Layout**
  - Transform main area into a responsive image gallery
  - Display all generated images in the current chat
  - Implement card-based design for each image

  - Show prompt in scrollable 2-line text field
  - Add control buttons at the bottom:
    - Download image button
    - View full-size button (new)
    - Regenerate image button (new)
    - Copy prompt button
  - Visual indicators for generation status

### 3. Bottom Panel - Prompt Controls

- **Persistent Prompt Input**
  - Keep prompt input field at the bottom
  - Maintain editability at all times
  - Automatic height adjustment based on content

- **Control Buttons**
  - Generate button (creates new image card)
  - Lightbulb button for future "enhance prompt" feature

- **Style Quick-Select**
  - Add eight style preset buttons for quick selection
  - Visual indication of active style

  - Enhanced API request timeout handling with proper error messages
  - Added robust response validation for error conditions
  - Fixed binary image data extraction from API responses
  - Improved API key validation and error reporting
  - Extended timeout duration to accommodate longer generation times

- **Error Handling Enhancements**:
  - Added comprehensive error states for API timeouts and failures
  - Implemented visual indicators for different error types
  - Ensured error messages persist in the UI rather than disappearing
  - Added detailed logging throughout the API request/response cycle
  - Created fallback mechanisms to preserve error state when API calls fail

## Future Enhancements
