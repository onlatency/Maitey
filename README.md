## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Venice API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Venice API key:

   ```env
   VITE_VENICE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
